Replacing incandescent bulbs with LED bulbs is one of the most effective ways to reduce energy consumption in your home. LEDs use up to 75% less energy than traditional bulbs, and they last much longer, making them an excellent long-term investment.

Efficiency Nova Scotia emphasizes that LEDs are available in a wide range of styles and brightness levels, making them a versatile choice for any home. By switching to LEDs, homeowners can save on electricity costs while reducing their environmental footprint. Additionally, LEDs produce less heat compared to incandescent bulbs, which can help reduce cooling costs during the warmer months.
