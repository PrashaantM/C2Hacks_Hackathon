To compost organic kitchen waste, you can: 
Set up a compost bin or pile: Choose a dry, shady, and well-drained area. 
Add materials: Include a mix of greens (high in nitrogen, like food scraps) and browns (high in carbon, like dead leaves). The ratio of brown to green should be around 30:1. You can also add shredded newspaper or dry leaves to the bottom of the bin. 
Moisten: Keep the compost moist, but not too wet. It should feel like a wrung-out sponge. 
Turn: Regularly turn the compost pile to circulate oxygen and break down organic matter faster. 
Monitor: Compost is ready when it's dark brown in color, has cooled, and has broken down into small, soil-like particles. This can take anywhere from two weeks to two years. 
Use: Apply compost as you would traditional fertilizer.
