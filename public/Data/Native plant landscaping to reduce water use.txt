Native plant landscaping is an environmentally friendly practice that helps reduce water use by incorporating plants that are naturally suited to the local climate. These plants are adapted to the soil and weather conditions, requiring little to no irrigation once established. Unlike non-native plants that may require frequent watering, native species thrive with minimal water, which significantly lowers the overall water consumption for landscaping.

The Canadian Wildlife Federation highlights the importance of using native plants in gardens and yards to support local wildlife and promote biodiversity. Native plants also have deeper root systems that help retain moisture and prevent soil erosion. By replacing traditional turf lawns, which consume vast amounts of water, with native plant landscapes, homeowners can create a sustainable, water-efficient outdoor environment.
